This is a patch for rockbox which replaces usb functionality with that of psgroove.

Currently it is only functional on PP502x targets, and has only been tested on a
5th generation ipod video.

Additionally, the descriptors/payload is the vanilla psgroove data at the moment.
I hope to eventually port Aaron's changes to build descriptors at compile time...
or someone else can do this change and commit it :)
